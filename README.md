# To do app... angular 17 using signals

## starting-structure
- Here is just add all the structure without logic.
- Wi will use just one component. ===> app.component
- Create the full html + css structure of the app. This means the differens looks of parts: (active imputs toggles etc).
- Add styles.css for html body 
- In the app.component.html create all the base to work with. 
- In the app.component.css add all the styles needed. 
- New folder 'models' then add the 'taskmodel'. 
- Import the task model in the app.component.ts. (this will help in the future).
- Also I make a favicon ;)
